# Time transformations for ordinary differential equations

Ordinary differential equations are a powerful modeling tool.
Unfortunately, they can exhibit nasty behavior.
Time transformations are a neat trick to tame numerical issues that arise, for instance, with finite escape times.
The idea is to stretch time to a new domain where the solution behaves better.
To do so we need to derive the dynamics in the new, the transformed time.
That's what we study theoretically and by example.

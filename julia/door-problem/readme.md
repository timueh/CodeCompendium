# Door Problem

Suppose you find yourself in front of 100 doors, all of which are closed.
You possess the keys to all of them and you begin to wonder: what happens if you open and close the doors according to the following pattern:

1. You walk by every door and open it. Having reached and opened the last door, you walk back to the beginning.
    2. Back at the first door you decide to leave it open. You approach the second door which you now close. The third door you leave open, the fourth door you close. And so on. Having reached the last door you see: all doors 2, 4, 6, ..., 100 are open. You decide to walk back to the first door.
3. In your third run you toggle every third door (3, 6, 9,...). That means: if you come across a door that is open, you close it; if you come across a door that is closed, you open it. Having reached the 100th door you walk back to the beginning.
4. You know what's coming: you approach doors 4, 8, 12, ... and toggle them.

You repeat these steps up to 100. That means, your final walk is simply toggling the 100th door.

What doors are opened after your cumbersome procedure?
